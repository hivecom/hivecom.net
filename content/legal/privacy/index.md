## 1. Introduction

Welcome to Hivecom. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our website and services.

Hivecom is a community of friends hosting gameservers and building open source projects, operating on a non-profit basis where all donations are reinvested into server hosting costs or project funding.

**Our Core Privacy Principle**: Our goal is to know as little about you as possible and we are committed to maintaining this approach. We will never be sold to a larger entity that might change this philosophy.

## 2. Information We Collect

### 2.1 Account Information

When you create a user profile, we collect information such as:

- Username
- Email address
- Password (securely hashed)
- Optional profile information (avatar, biography, etc.)

### 2.2 Game Server Data

We collect information about:

- In-game usernames
- Connection times
- Gameplay statistics
- Online status

### 2.3 Service Usage Information

We may collect certain information when you use our services, primarily as a side-effect of providing these services rather than through intentional gathering:

- IP addresses (e.g., when you connect to a game server, the server software naturally logs your connection)
- Browser type and user agent (automatically provided by your browser when accessing our website)
- Operating system
- Access times
- Pages viewed

We do not use this information for profit or any other gain and will NEVER share it with third parties. This information is collected only to maintain and improve our services.

### 2.4 Communication Services

For our IRC and Teamspeak services:

- We maintain minimal logs of public channels and connection information
- Private conversations are not logged or recorded in any way
- Direct user-to-user communications (via IRC queries or Teamspeak private channels) have zero logging

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the information we collect to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve our services
- Create and manage your account
- Process and display game server information
- Facilitate community voting and referendum processes
- Ensure the security of our services
- Communicate with you about updates or changes to our services

## 4. Information Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We may share information in the following circumstances:

- With your consent
- To comply with legal obligations
- To protect the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public

## 5. Data Security

We implement appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet transmission is completely secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of your information.

## 6. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- Access the personal information we hold about you
- Correct inaccurate or incomplete information
- Delete your personal information
- Restrict or object to certain processing activities
- Withdraw consent where applicable

To exercise these rights, please contact us at <contact@hivecom.net>.

## 7. Children's Privacy

Our services are not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.
